        <h1>Mule Lint</h1>

        <p>The mule-lint application is an open source project to provide basic
        static analysis checking of certain elements of a Mule Integration
        Application. This is a growing concern and a project has been spun up
        to help fill this gap. This open source project was started by Chad
        Gorshing, an Independent MuleSoft Certified Consultant (not an employee
        of MuleSoft, but has partnered on multiple occasions), and features are
        still being developed.</p>

        <p>There are "rules" that need to be checked that have specific use
        cases and a predefined rules can not be already created. So as a guide,
        here are a few things to keep in mind on what could fit for your
        business use cases.</p>

        <p>Many "rules" are still subjective and we continually are learning
        what rules can easily work and be a good foundation for others to
        follow.</p>

        <h3>Running as part of your build</h3>

        <p>Currently this project will not cause a build failure, but only
        provide information for others to act upon. Teams will need to decide
        for themselves what constitutes a failure for their cases.  Just
        because a rule is "broken" once does not necessarily warrant a build or
        deployment failure.  We feel that this is up the team to decide what
        level is good for them to proceed (if any at all).</p>

        <p>We would love to hear what features you would like next by opening an
        issue on <a href="https://github.com/nuisto/mule-lint/issues">Github</a>.

        <h3>Employee Contributions</h3>

        <p>Many companies have discovered that providing employees with some time to pursue an interesting idea can pay big dividends or even spawn entirely new products.</p>

        <p>If you sponsor your employee's work on open source projects and would like to contribute to Rubinius, <a href="mailto:contact@rubinius.com?subject=Sponsoring employee contributions to Rubinius">tell us about it</a> so we can give your company and employee the credit they deserve.</p>

        <h3>The Rubinius Book</h3>

        <p>The forms of communicating knowledge are expanding tremendously with the Internet and the rich digital media it enables. Even so, books remain one of the most effective ways to organize information for sharing.</p>

        <p>The Rubinius book is an ambitious project to completely document the Rubinius platform, development approach, community social structure, problem solving, and experimentation with programming languages. Sponsoring Rubinius book content provides one of the highest returns in a virtuous circle of learning and building, and <a href="mailto:contact@rubinius.com?subject=Sponsoring Rubinius book content">your sponsorship</a> would receive prominent recognition in the book.</p>

        <p>Academia and industry have different goals. Academia prioritize novelty. Since big ideas are few, this leads to specialization ond then compartmentalization. Business must be profitable to exist, so industry prioritizes working systems that generate revenue. These systems are rarely novel and tend quickly toward complexity.</p>

        <p>The Rubinius book balances these opposed goals by documenting a complete, complex, working system, while encouraging focused, specialized learning or research.</p>

        <h3>Interns and Student Projects</h3>

        <p>Learning to code is becoming increasingly important, and not merely for a career in software development. As all professions use software more, and as software becomes more controllable through APIs (application programming interfaces), there is more opportunity or need to write code.</p>

        <p>One of the focuses of Rubinius is learning about programming systems. It provides an excellent opportunity for an intern or student to gain practical experience with a complete industrial system like one they would encounter in a job versus only an academic research system. You can sponsor one of your interns to work on Rubinius or <a href="mailto:contact@rubinius.com?subject=Sponsoring an intern or student">work with us</a> to find a code school or university student to sponsor.</p>

        <p>Rubinius is an extensive project composed of many components. We prioritize features based on what we know about how useful they can be. If there are features that would be particularly valuable to your business, <a href="mailto:contact@rubinius.com?subject=Funding specific Rubinius projects">let's discuss</a> how you might fund focused work on those features. You agree that the work be contributed to Rubinius and your business would receive prominent recognition for the contribution in <a href="http://book.rubinius.com">the Rubinius book</a>.</p>

        <p>Rubinius is pursing ambitious advances in the utility of programming languages and applications. Various components that significantly advance the Rubinius vision would benefit from funding.</p>

        <p>From monolithic application architectures to microservices, from legacy IT infrastructure to cloud, containers, and serverless compute, the pace of technology change is accelerating. Staying current is essential to staying competitive. Yet this constant march forward should not come at the significant cost of discarding investments that are still providing value. Applications and infrastructure should be <em>evolving</em>, not merely getting replaced.</p>
