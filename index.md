        <h1>Mule Lint</h1>

        <p>The mule-lint application is an open source project to provide basic
        static analysis checking of certain elements of a Mule Integration
        Application. This is a growing concern and a project has been spun up
        to help fill this gap. This open source project was started by Chad
        Gorshing, an Independent MuleSoft Certified Consultant (not an employee
        of MuleSoft, but has partnered on multiple occasions), and features are
        still being developed.</p>

        <p>Rules are intended to be re-usable across many teams, where as the options could be team specific (files to ignore, dictionary)</p>

        <p>There are "rules" that need to be checked that have specific use
        cases and a predefined rules can not be already created. So as a guide,
        here are a few things to keep in mind on what could fit for your
        business use cases.</p>

        <p>Many "rules" are still subjective and we continually are learning
        what rules can easily work and be a good foundation for others to
        follow.</p>

        <h3>Running as part of your build</h3>

        <p>Currently this project will not cause a build failure, but only
        provide information for others to act upon. Teams will need to decide
        for themselves what constitutes a failure for their cases.  Just
        because a rule is "broken" once does not necessarily warrant a build or
        deployment failure.  We feel that this is up the team to decide what
        level is good for them to proceed (if any at all).</p>

        <p>We would love to hear what features you would like next by opening an
        issue on <a href="https://github.com/nuisto/mule-lint/issues">Github</a>.

        <h3>Flow Size</h3>

        <p>If you have been a part of a Mule project for a lenght of time, then I'm sure you have ran into flows that were just too big and needed to be broken down. This makes things easier for testing, understanding by others and your future self, follow single responsibility and so on.</p>

        <p>How can we bring some of these well known metrics into the Mule world, after all <a href="https://confluex.com/blog/integration-software-is-software/">Integration Software is Software</a>. Mule poses an interesting spin on this topic</p>

        <h3>The Rubinius Book</h3>

        <p>The forms of communicating knowledge are expanding tremendously with the Internet and the rich digital media it enables. Even so, books remain one of the most effective ways to organize information for sharing.</p>

        <p>The Rubinius book is an ambitious project to completely document the Rubinius platform, development approach, community social structure, problem solving, and experimentation with programming languages. Sponsoring Rubinius book content provides one of the highest returns in a virtuous circle of learning and building, and <a href="mailto:contact@rubinius.com?subject=Sponsoring Rubinius book content">your sponsorship</a> would receive prominent recognition in the book.</p>

        <p>Academia and industry have different goals. Academia prioritize novelty. Since big ideas are few, this leads to specialization ond then compartmentalization. Business must be profitable to exist, so industry prioritizes working systems that generate revenue. These systems are rarely novel and tend quickly toward complexity.</p>

        <p>The Rubinius book balances these opposed goals by documenting a complete, complex, working system, while encouraging focused, specialized learning or research.</p>

        <h3>Interns and Student Projects</h3>

        <p>Learning to code is becoming increasingly important, and not merely for a career in software development. As all professions use software more, and as software becomes more controllable through APIs (application programming interfaces), there is more opportunity or need to write code.</p>

        <p>One of the focuses of Rubinius is learning about programming systems. It provides an excellent opportunity for an intern or student to gain practical experience with a complete industrial system like one they would encounter in a job versus only an academic research system. You can sponsor one of your interns to work on Rubinius or <a href="mailto:contact@rubinius.com?subject=Sponsoring an intern or student">work with us</a> to find a code school or university student to sponsor.</p>
